# Financial-Analysis-with-Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Companies

This project aims to perform time series forecasting for the world's largest public companies, using data from Forbes' "Global 2000" rankings. The dataset spans from 2008 to 2023, including company financials such as Sales, Profits, Assets, and Market Value. The goal is to predict future financial metrics based on historical data, using a variety of regression models and deep learning techniques.

## Key Components:
Data Preprocessing: Merged and cleaned data from multiple years, reshaped into a multi-index DataFrame for time series analysis.\
Algorithms Used: Lasso, Ridge Regression, 1D CNN, and Neural Networks for forecasting.\
Feature Engineering: Sales, Profits, Assets, and Market Value were separated into individual datasets for analysis and prediction.\
Model Evaluation: Model performance evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

## Libraries and Technologies:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn)\
Time Series Data Reshaping\
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modular code development\
The project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to forecast financial metrics for companies based on historical performance, offering valuable insights for decision-making.
